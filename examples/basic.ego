Here's a number: @(some_number)
@if some_number > 0 {
  If the variable 'some_number' in our context is greater than one then
  this content is written.
  @if some_number > 5 {
    Then this one...
  } else {
    Nope...
  }
}else{
  Otherwise this content is written.
}

Here's some more numbers:
@for i, e := range some_array {
  @(i) -> @(e)
}

Ok, that's it!
